Exploring Wealth Accumulation with a Ability-Luck Perspective: Using ABM Method

This is my individual programe from UCL CASA (Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis). This model is an agent-based model (ABM) developed using NetLogo, and requires version 6.4.0 or higher of NetLogo to operate seamlessly.

The relative roles of luck and ability in wealth accumulation are topics of frequent contemplation. Commonly, it is assumed that individuals with greater abilities have a distinct advantage in acquiring wealth. However, our study, through the development of an ABM, reveals that ability might not be a necessary prerequisite for wealth accumulation, even not important. On a macroscopic level, the distribution of wealth within society appears to exhibit a significant degree of randomness, suggesting that luck may play a more crucial role in determining an individual's total wealth.

This research builds upon the IgNobel prize-winning study "Talent versus luck: The role of randomness in success and failure" (Pluchino et al., 2018). The original study ambiguously defined talent as merely influencing the probability of wealth doubling. In reality, capable individuals are likely to engage in more activities that promote wealth accumulation, such as identifying opportunities more effectively and mitigating wealth losses. In refining our model, we have further clarified the role of ability by incorporating factors such as proactive opportunity seeking, resistance to misfortune, field of vision, mobility speed, focus duration, and economic booms/recessions, aligning it more closely with real-world scenarios. Additionally, we have integrated a series of metrics for graphical analysis, such as the wealth share of the top 20% richest individuals, ability values of the wealthiest entities, distribution of ability levels within the top 20% wealthiest group, and wealth trajectory of the most capable individuals, enabling researchers to conduct more in-depth analyses.

Overall, our model not only replicates the findings of Pluchino and colleagues but also enhances their model significantly. The results still suggest that luck is a key determinant in wealth accumulation rather than ability. This conclusion aligns with previous research and underscores a pattern in modern societal wealth accumulation. Despite the substantial influence of ability on wealth acquisition, luck remains the pivotal element in determining whether an individual becomes affluent. Future research could further refine this model and delve deeper into the underlying sociological and philosophical reasons behind this phenomenon.
